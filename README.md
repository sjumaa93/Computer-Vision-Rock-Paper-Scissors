# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

The model 'keras_model_h5' has been trained to detect whether I am showing rock, paper or scissors. The computer game then randomly generates rock, paper or scissors. And then a winner of that move is decided.

# Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- Keras
- Tensorflow

# How it Works

1. The game counts down from 3.
2. The user shows the camera either 'rock','paper' or 'scissors' to the webcam.
3. The computer randomly chooses 'rock', 'paper' or 'scissors'.
4. A winner is decided for that round.
5. The game is repeated till a winner is decided. First to win 3 times wins.
