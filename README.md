# Computer-Vision-Rock-Paper-Scissors

The model 'keras_model_h5' has been trained to detect whether I am showing rock, paper or scissors. The computer game then randomly generates rock, paper or scissors. And then a winner of that move is decided.

A virtual enviroment was set up and installed with opencv, tensorflow and kernal. All of which are needed to run the program.
